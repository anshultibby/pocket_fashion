Repo for testing out smart closet idea
Trying to create an algorithm which will:
1. Identify the clothes you are wearing and create an inventory
2. Keep track of frequency of clothes that you are wearing
3. Recommend outfits as a combination of frequency and match, with goals to maximise user seredipity.
4. Allow virtual try outs by showing you photos of you with an outfit.
5. Crawl the web to look for outfits that complete your closet, as a personal shopper.
